Title: SHA 1 / SHA-1 / SHA1 Secure Hash Algorithm Fast!
Description: This program includes a class module useful for generating SHA1 hash's, I claim it to be the fastest SHA routine written in pure VB on PSC.
There's also a test bed application to demonstrate the usage of the class.
If you find a faster SHA 1 implementation (in pure VB,ie: no external DLL's) I'll remove this statement!
Honestly though, for most applications speed is not really an issue due to the fact that most data that gets hashed is small.
Thanks to Phil Fresle, some of the functions inside here are his.
Enjoy!
