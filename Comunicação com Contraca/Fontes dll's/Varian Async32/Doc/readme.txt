First we like to thank everybody for their support,
great comments and suggestions. We are convinced that
together we can make this the best communications library
available today!

Varian Async32 contains components, objects and routines 
for Borland Delphi with full source code. This library is 
designed for Borland Delphi 3/4/5 and C++ Builder 4. The 
library provides serial communications for your application 
by allowing the transmission and reception of data through 
a serial port.

We would be glad about some suggestions or some criticism 
for an improvement of this package. Therefore we hope for a 
large feedback!
