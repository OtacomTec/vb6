General
-------

- Introduced new units and revised parts of the
  original code.

New Components
--------------

- TVaModem, unit VaModem

New properties & Events
-----------------------

TVaComm
-------
- Update declaration of TVaComm Event
  Old:
  TVaCommEvent = (ceBreak, ceCts, ceDsr, ceError, ceRing, ceRlsd, ceData, ceTxEmpty, ceEvent);
  New:
  TVaCommEvent = (ceBreak, ceCts, ceDsr, ceError, ceRing, ceRlsd, ceRxChar, ceTxEmpty, ceRxFlag);

  Warning: Make sure you reset the MonitorEvents property in your application!

- Changed OnDataEvent to
  property OnRxChar: TVaCommRxCharEvent;

- Splitted Thread comm event in a OnLineEvent and a OnDataEvent

- New event OnRxBuf;
  TVaCommRxBufEvent = procedure(Sender: TObject; const Buf: PChar; Count: Integer) of object;
  Is called only when a TVaDataSource is connected to the comport component. The
  data is read from the comport and dispatched through the datasource. After
  dispatching OnRxBuf is called with the available data as a parameter.

- New property "AutoOpen".
  property AutoOpen: boolean;

- New property "DeviceName"
  property DeviceName: string;
  DeviceName describes the communications portname. If an
  %d parameter is included the portnumber defined by PortNum
  is added to the DeviceName when the device is openend.

  PortNum = 2 DeviceName = COM%d -> COM2
  PortNum = 2 DeviceName = COM1  -> COM1

TVaDataSource
-------------

- Removed OnData event. See TVaComm.OnRxBuf for more 
  information.

TVaWaitMessage
--------------

- Now also handles control characters embedded in the
  Strings property. eg ^M = #13

- Added OnLine property.
                        
TVaBuffer
---------

- Added OnLine property.


Bugfixes
--------

TVaComm
-------
- Fixed error in flowcontrol declaration
  TVaFlowControl = (fcNone, fcXonXoff, fcRtsCts, fcDtrDsr);
  Instead of RtsCts control, XonXoff was used.
