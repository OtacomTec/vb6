   1. OVERVIEW
=======================================================
ACTIVELOCK is an antipiracy tool and a way to get  more
information about  your  users,  all  rolled  into  one 
compact control.  Use  ActiveLock  to  disable  certain
features of your application  until  it  is  registered
(the "crippleware"  approach),  or  have  the  software
disable itself entirely after a set time ("trialware").
If your application is strictly freeware, you  can  use
ActiveLock to solicit user information. You  build  the
forms that ActiveLock uses to interact with  the  user;
the control itself just handles  what  goes  on  behind
the scenes. (ACTIVEX.COM DISPATCH - Vol. 3, No. 3)

   2. INSTALL NOTES:
=======================================================
This zip file contains ActiveLock 1.5 for VB5 and  VB6,
KeyGenerator and sample code. It is very important that
you install ActiveLock correctly, or you won't  be able
to use the control / sample code.

1. Extract all the files to any folder;

2. Execute (double-click) install.bat. 

3. Enable ActiveLock control in the Controls tab of the
   Visual Basic Components dialog box.

If you have any problems to register ActiveLock on your
system, try to register it  manually:  Click  on  Start
menu, select "Run" and type:
   regsvr32 [path]\nslock15vb5.ocx
   regsvr32 [path]\nslock15vb6.ocx
