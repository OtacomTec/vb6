Dear ActiveLock user,

I'm writing  you since you are  a registered ActiveLock  user, and I'd
like  to tell you  that ActiveLock  1.7 was  just released,  with full
source code.

I  would like  to take  this opportunity  to thank  you and  all those
people who  have used ActiveLock, my friends  and contributors, people
who sent encouraging messages and helped me in many ways.

The original  motivation behind ActiveLock was to  help developers get
more  information  about  their   customers.   The  first  version  of
ActiveLock (1.0)  was released  as a Visual  Basic class  module, with
source code, on October/1998.

The first "componentized" version of ActiveLock (1.5) was released few
months later, as freeware, with no  source code. In four weeks, it had
exceeded  2 thousand  downloads at  Download.com and  was  between the
top-ten components at SoftSeek.

Soon  I started  receiving  contributions from  the ActiveLock  users,
including documentation and translations. That was really great!

Some people  wanted to contribute with  source code and  ideas but, by
the end of 1999, I had  almost stopped working with Windows and Visual
Basic, releasing  a single  update, ActiveLock 1.6,  for VB5  only. By
that time  I was using GNU/Linux, and  didn't want to buy  VB6 just to
recompile ActiveLock in the "new" programming platform.  But thanks to
the  interest  from all  those  people,  I  was motivated  to  develop
ActiveLock 1.7 and release it as open source software.

The open source license allow developers to be free from the strategic
decisions from the platform owner,  and will allow you to use, change,
recompile and  port ActiveLock to  your platform of choice:  VB4, VB5,
VB6, .NET, Java, Delphi, etc...

You'll find the complete ActiveLock 1.7 source code here:

I have also created a group to foster ActiveLock development at Yahoo!
Groups:

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/activelock/

If you have a web site, or know other VB developers, please help me to
promote ActiveLock!

Thank you and happy programming,

Nelson

P.S.: Let me  know if you have interest  on GNU/Linux, web development
and open  source software, because  I have other open  source projects
that will be released on the next few weeks.
